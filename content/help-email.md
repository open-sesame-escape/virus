Good job! You have reestablished my connection to our communication and
research notes. Since General Halftrack isolated me 3 days ago, I have
been desperate  for help.

To start, I need you to find the formula to the virus treatment that I
developed merely 2 day before I left for this emergency trip. Sensing
danger, I locked away my notes, and it appears I was right to do so. I
cannot give you instructions directly over this insecure channel, but you
are clever and I know you will figure it out.

Next, I need you create a secure cryptographic link to me so that we can
talk more freely. This can only be done from within my private lab. My lab
is locked, so you will have to break in.

These 16 weeks on the road have been exhausting, and I'm so glad to be
able to talk to you again.
