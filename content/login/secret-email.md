Thank goodness you were able to get into the lab and access our secure
communication system! I have a lot to tell you that you must keep secret.

My investigation of NEONORO patients has revealed something startling. We all
know that 5-10% of patients develop serious intestinal problems. But this turns
out to be only a minor side effect of the disease. The true nature is much, much
worse.

We have found that the virus lies dormant in seemingly healthy patients. Over
the course of about 6 months the virus mutates, and its behavior changes. At
this point, the disease attacks the cerebrum, drastically reducing cognitive
function. From there, the virus rapidly progresses to the adrenal glands, which
respond by generating capacious amounts of cortisone and adrenaline. At this
point, the patient becomes mindlessly aggressive.

For lack of a better term, these victims are turning into zombies. They
ruthlessly attack any living thing within reach. And as they salivate and bite,
they continually spread the disease to other victims. I estimate we have about 4
days to contain this before we have a global disaster.

Keep this on the down low! In particular, I do not trust General Halftrack. The
behavior of this virus suggest there might have been some military engineering
behind it.

Fortunately, I have prepared for this (rather predictable) event. I stockpiled
some supplies in the laboratory. Unfortunately, I don't remember where I put
everything. Start by looking in my briefcase. The code is 4288.

Once you have gathered everything, I need you to come to me. Hurry!
